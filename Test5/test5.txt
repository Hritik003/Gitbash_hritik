hello there! Welcome back.
In this test command, I have learnt how to undo commits.
We can use git revert/git reset/git clean/git rm for undoing private 
or public commits.

Once changes have been committed they are generally permanent

Use git checkout to move around and review the commit history

git revert is the best tool for undoing shared public changes

git reset is best used for undoing local private changes
