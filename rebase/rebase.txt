today its about git-rebase.
Many people get confused with git rebase and git merge.

--->Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. 

--->Rebasing is most useful and easily visualized in the context of a feature branching workflow.

--->The primary reason for rebasing is to maintain a linear project history

---> The moment rebase your feature branch into main branch, you history of the feature branch gets cleaned.

---> which means the commit history is completly gone.

---> one can undo git rebase using git reflog

"The difference is that git merge never cleans the commit history"
