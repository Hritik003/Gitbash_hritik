Hello there! this test consists all about the "Git diff command.
So git diff ---> is basically a comand that gives the difference between the staging area and the working area.
Supposedly we have a file named 'example.txt' and we have added it using "git add ." command.
All good!! perfect!!


But the moment I make some petty changes and commit it without adding it again "git add .", 
it will pop up an error.

At this point, it is known as the WORKING AREA and previous one was the STAGING AREA.
The difference btwn those two working areas is given by the command "Git diff".

:)
