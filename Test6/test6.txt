Hello there, welcome back
Today I learnt about the :-
--> Git amend command.
     It basically changes the commit messege of your recent commit history.

-->There are many ways to rewrite history with git.

-->Use git commit --amend to change your latest log message.

-->Use git commit --amend to make modifications to the most recent commit.

-->Use git rebase to combine commits and modify history of a branch.

-->git rebase -i gives much more fine grained control over history modifications than a standard git rebase.
